Once I given up on my corporate IT to let me finish this course, I decided to use my gaming PC running Windows 10.
In order to minimize 'OS noise' I used [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com) client 
and installed [Fedora](https://getfedora.org) on it.

I played with many Linux distros this way but it is always try & fail with exception of this, from my perspective best distro!
Thanks to Fedora community to make Linux great!
